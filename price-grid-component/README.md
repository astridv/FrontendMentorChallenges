![Design preview for the Single Price Grid Component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a responsive grid component made with HTML and CSS. Check out my solution here: https://frontend-mentor-challenges-teal.vercel.app/

## The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

This is a Frontend Mentor challenge. Check out more challenges here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges

## The Provided Design 

The task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. There was both a mobile (375px) and desktop version (1440px)of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

The required assets are in the `/images` folder. There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information like color palette and fonts.
