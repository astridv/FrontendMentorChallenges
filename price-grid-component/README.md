# Frontend Mentor - Single Price Grid Component

![Design preview for the Single Price Grid Component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a responsive grid component made with HTML and CSS. Check out my solution here: https://frontend-mentor-challenges-teal.vercel.app/

## The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

This is a Frontend Mentor challenge. Check out more challenges here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges

## The Provided Design 

The task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. There was both a mobile (375px) and desktop version (1440px)of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

The required assets are in the `/images` folder. There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information like color palette and fonts.

## Browser Compatibility
The component has been tested in Chrome, Firefox and Firefox Developer. Note that I'm using some properties (e.g. place-items) and CSS variables that are *not* supported by IE. 

## Accessibility 

The app scores pretty well on accessibility, however, the color contrast does not meet the WCAG standards for accessible text. The colours were already provided, and as my goal was to match the design as close as possible I let them be. However, if it were to be used by actual users I would change the colors to improve accessibility.
