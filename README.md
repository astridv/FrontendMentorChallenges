# Frontend Mentor Challenges

## Hello there! 👋
This repository contains my solutions to challenges from Frontend Mentor ✨ What is Frontend Mentor you ask? It's a site that let's you improve your front-end coding skills by building real projects. Check it out [here](https://frontendmentor.io) if you're curious. 


## So whatcha working on?? 👩‍💻
I just discovered Frontend Mentor myself, and as someone who struggles coming up with nice design & wants to improve their web development skills, I think it is brilliant! 😍 I just completed my first challenge (a mobile first reponsive grid componentent), and now I plan to continue working on this sweet article preview component:
