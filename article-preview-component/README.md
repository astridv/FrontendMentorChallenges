# Frontend Mentor - Article preview component

![Design preview for the Article preview component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a responsive card component made with HTML, CSS and some basic JavaScript to toggle the social media icons. Check out a live demo of the solution [here](https://av-frontendmentor-challenges.vercel.app/article-preview-component/index.html).

## The challenge

The task was to build an article preview component matching the design found inside the `/design` folder. There was both a mobile (375px) and desktop version (1440px)of the design. 

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The only JavaScript you'll need for this challenge is to initiate the share options when someone clicks the share icon.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## Browser Compatibility
The component has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, Firefox Developer and Safari. Note that I'm using some properties (e.g.`place-items`) and `CSS variables` that are *not* supported by IE.
