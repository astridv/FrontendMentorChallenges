# Frontend Mentor - Article preview component

![Design preview for the Article preview component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

This is a responsive card component made with HTML, CSS and some basic JavaScript to toggle the social media icons. Check out a live demo of the solution [here](https://av-frontendmentor-challenges.vercel.app/article-preview-component/index.html).

## The challenge

The task was to build an article preview component matching the design found inside the `/design` folder. There was both a mobile (375px) and desktop version (1440px)of the design. 

The users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## Browser Compatibility
The component has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, Firefox Developer and Safari. Note that I'm using some properties (e.g.`place-items`) and `CSS variables` that are *not* supported by IE. 

## Alphabetizing CSS properties
Something new I tried out for this challenge was to alphabetize the CSS properties. This was a pain at first, but luckily I quickly found I could set a VSC shortcut to help me out. It was pretty neat as I discovered some places where I had acciedentally set a property twice ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
